                  <p>Little Kids Rock is the original pioneer of “Modern Band” in the United States public school system. The increasing presence of Modern Band and popular music education at the primary and secondary levels presents forward-looking music teacher education programs with an excellent opportunity to fully prepare their students to teach in the classrooms of tomorrow.
                    As a leader in the field of culturally relevant, inclusive and student-centered music education, we partner with colleges and universities across the country to help share best practices, develop leadership and create sustainable coursework in popular music education approaches.</p>
